# Big CSV to Json extractor

this script allows to handle big CSV files that can't be used directly and extract only desired records.

**used solution** : stream reading and line by line processing


## Usage : 
the script version of it consiste of two files : main.js and helpers.js

the main.js contains the main functions and the even more important the CONSTANTES that will allow to configure 
the execution of the script such as : 

- ```FILE_NAME = 'data.csv'; ```  the name of source CSV file.
- ```RESULT_FILE_NAME  = 'users.json';```  the name of output JSON file.
- ```COUNT_OF_RECORDS_TO_SAVE = 1517;```  the count of records to be extracted in the output json file
- ```COUNT_OF_RECORDS_TO_SAVE = 'uid';```  the column's name to use as unique records id
- ```RECORD_UNIQUE_ATTRIBUTES = 'createdAt';```  the column's name to use as sorting id 
- ```NUMBER_OF_RECORDS_PROGRESS_DISPLAY  = 10000;```  the interval of records count to display progress in the console

once the configuration done you can launch the script with commandes :

```
- yarn
- yarn extract
```

## Complexity : O(n)
for the complexity of the main algorithm of sorting data and saving only desired records :

- let **"n"** : be the number of lines in the original CSV file
- let **"m"** : be the number of desired records to be extracted  ***COUNT_OF_RECORDS_TO_SAVE***

for each line in the original file we need to sort only **"m"** records at maximum with complexity of **"O(m)""**,
and only if the sortingValue is bigger than the latest element of the list.

that give us a global Algorithm with the complexity of : **"O( n x m )"**

and knowing the intended use of the script : m <<< n  which leave us with the complexity of : **"O(n)"**



## Algorithm :
  the algorithm of sorting data and saving only desired records :

    A[file stream ] -->|read a line| B(Line)
    A[file stream ] -->|read first line| D(Headers)

    B --> C(spliting to columns)
    C --> |double quotes => singles|C(spliting to columns)
    C --> |unwrap from quotes |C((spliting to columns))

    C --> E(columns)
    E(columns) --> F(JSON record)
    D(Headers) --> F(JSON record)

    F(JSON record) --> |saving the record| k{should it be add} 
    k{should it be add} --> |No old record| R(ignore)
    k{should it be add}  -->  |recent record| G{is unique id existe}

    G{is the array still free}-->  |YES : save directly | I[save]
    G{is the array still free} --> |NO : find element to replace| l{is the array still free}

    l{is unique id existe} --> |NO:delete oldest in list| N(add and keep sorting of array)
    l{is unique id existe} --> |YES:delete record with same id| N(add and keep sorting of array)

    I[save] --> X((List of latest records))
    N(add and keep sorting of array) --> X((List of latest records))
    R(ignore) --> X((List of latest records))
```
